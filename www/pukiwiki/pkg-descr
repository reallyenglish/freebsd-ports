PukiWiki consists of a series of PHP Scripts designed to build 
a collection of web pages which can be edited by anyone without any restriction.
Pukiwiki is more flexible than moderate bulletinboards.
Since it ,basically, enables everyone change the design and content of any 
page, while you can only leave messages in bulletinboards.

PukiWiki is a unique Wiki-Engine which is based on the YukiWiki specification 
created by Mr. Hiroshi Yuki.
Mr. yu-ji continued its development until the release of PukiWiki 1.3, and 
PukiWiki Developers Team inherited the development from him after 1.3.1b.

PukiWiki is written in PHP, so it's relatively easy to install
on a web server which supports PHP.

PukiWiki is distributed under GPL. Thus it is, so to speak, a  Free Software!
