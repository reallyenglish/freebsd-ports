Grafana is meant to be a general purpose dashboard replacement for Graphite.
Graphite is an incredible time series database and metric visualization tool.
However the default dashboard and graph editor leaves much to be desired. The
goal for Grafana is to be a dashboard and graph editor that is flexible,
feature rich, easy to use and beautiful with low noice and clutter in its
visual presentation.
